## Which Thinkific Pricing Plan Is Right for You?

Thinkific has a few plans, and with Thinkific promo codes, they’re cheaper than ever. Let’s break it down with a fun table:

| **Plan** | **Monthly Price** | **Yearly Price (Monthly Equivalent)** | **Annual Savings** | **Best For** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | $0 | $0 | $0 | Beginners testing the platform or creating a single course with minimal features |
| Basic | $49 | $432 ($36/month) | $156 | New course creators are launching multiple courses with basic marketing tools |
| Start | $99 | $888 ($74/month) | $300 | Small teams or creators building engaging courses with memberships and live sessions |
| Grow | $199 | $1,788 ($149/month) | $600 | Established creators or businesses scaling with advanced marketing and analytics |

## Why You Should Choose Thinkific?

Having an online course builder is a must when you have a killer idea for an online course.

An online teaching tool like Thinkific speeds up your course creation and selling your course to the targeted audience. It saves a lot of your time.

And Thinkific is trusted by 50,000+ creators, for example, teachers, fitness gurus, and even dog trainers.

Here’s a detailed rundown of why it’s the top pick, and how promo codes sweeten the deal, all laid out clearly with no fluff.

👉 No Transaction Fees to Eat Your Profits:

Pay zero transaction fees when selling courses through Thinkific Payments, just standard processor fees (e.g., Stripe’s 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction in the US).

👉 Brand It Like It’s Yours:

Your course should scream “you,” and Thinkific makes that easy.

- Add your logo and pick brand colors to match your vibe.
- Use a custom domain (Basic plan and up, ~$10–$15/year for the domain) for a pro look, like “YourSchool.com.”
- On Grow ($199/month) and higher, remove Thinkific’s branding entirely, so your course feels like a standalone academy. This builds trust—students see a polished, branded site and are more likely to enroll and stay engaged.

👉 Unlimited Students, No Limits:

Teach as many people as you want without extra costs.

- Every plan, from Free ($0) to Expand ($499/month), supports unlimited students.
- Enroll 10 or 10,000—your bill doesn’t budge. Compare that to platforms that charge per user or cap your audience, forcing pricey upgrades. With Thinkific, you can dream big and scale fast without worrying about hidden fees.

👉 Tools to Make Your Course Pop:

Thinkific is loaded with features to create engaging, interactive courses, no tech skills needed.

- Upload videos, quizzes, and downloadable resources to keep students hooked.
- Add live lessons or Zoom integrations (Start plan, $99/month, and up) for real-time teaching.
- Build communities where students connect—Free plan includes 1 community (2 spaces), while Grow offers 3 communities (20 spaces).
- Offer assignments, certificates, memberships, or payment plans (Start-up) to boost engagement and revenue. The drag-and-drop builder is so simple that anyone—artists, coaches, or small business owners—can create a course in hours.

👉 Hassle-Free and Supportive:

Thinkific handles the techy stuff so you can focus on teaching.

- Secure hosting and payment processing are built in, no extra setup required.
- The platform’s intuitive, letting you launch without coding knowledge.
- Need help? Email or chat support is available, with priority support on Grow and higher. Plus, free tutorials and webinars guide you every step. This makes it perfect for busy creators who want results, not headaches.

## Make Your Thinkific Course Shine

Once you’ve got your plan with a Thinkific promo code, here’s how to make it amazing:

- Check Analytics: Thinkific shows you who’s watching your course. If lots of people stop at Lesson 3, maybe make it more fun!
- Add Zoom: Have live chats with students—like a virtual classroom. I did this once, and everyone loved it.
- Build a Club: Use the “Community” tool so students can talk to each other. It’s like a little fan club!
- Fancy Quizzes: Make quizzes to test what they learned. Kids love getting stars for right answers.

Secondly, Thinkific software is simplified, so you'll be able to start creating your course in 30 days or less. Thirdly, once you've completed creating your course on the free tier, you may select the additional features that you want to have on your course site by subscribing to the paid tier of your choice.
