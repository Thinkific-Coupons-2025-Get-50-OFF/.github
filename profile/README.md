Jane the Baker: Jane’s a mom who loves cookies. She started on the Free plan, made a “Cookie Magic” course, and earned $100,000! She used Thinkific’s video tools to show every step, kneading dough, adding sprinkles, everything.

Source: [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/675a8377eaf8e8cfdc006691):

“The best e-learning software I've experienced, the free forever tier is the best for anyone to learn the how-tos of Thinkific without having to pay for subscription fees, unlike others, you need to pay after 14 days if you haven't fully understood the system. Secondly, Thinkific software is simplified, so you'll be able to start creating your course in 30 days or less. Thirdly, once you've completed creating your course on the free tier, you may select the additional features that you want to have on your course site by subscribing to the paid tier of your choice. No other software has the flexibility that Thinkific can offer.”

These people started small, just like you might. With Thinkific deals, they turned dreams into real stuff. You could too!
